## Enforcing Azure AD Access Reviews decisions on on-premises-managed groups (AzureADAccessReviewsOnPremises)

## Prerequisites
This Powershell module runs in an application context, which requires that you create an application registration in Azure AD for this script, and admin-consent for the required permissions for Microsoft Graph.

The steps are as follows:
1. Log into the Azure portal as a global administrator.
2. In the Azure portal, go to Azure Active Directory, and then click App registrations on the left.
3. Click New registration. Give your app a name, and then click Register.
4. Copy and save for later the application (client) ID that appears after the app is registered.
5. On the left, click API permissions.
6. Click "Add a permission", click "Microsoft Graph", and then click "Application permissions".
7. In the Select permissions list, select the following permissions: (a) AccessReview.Read.All, (b) Group.Read.All and (c) User.Read.All.
8. Click Add permissions.
9. Click to Grant admin consent for <your tenant> and then click Yes. The status for each permission the app needs should change to a green checkmark, indicating consent was granted.
10. On the left, click Certificates & secrets.
11. Click New client secret and then for Expires select an expiry date that's a month away in the future. This will allow you to test sensibly, but not infinitely keep the credentials/secret valid. Click Add.
12. Copy and save locally the value of the secret that appears- you wonâ€™t see it again after you leave this part of the UI.

### Function Get-AzureADARSingleReviewOnPrem

Get-AzureADARSingleReviewOnPrem -reviewId "20924e60-a9fb-4891-9c92-f30c47636484" -filePath "C:\temp\WindowsADCommands.txt"

 .Synopsis
  Retrieves decisions for a single Access Review and displays Powershell commands for Windows Active Directory to be executed to apply Access Reviews results on-premises.

 .Description
  Retrieves the decisions for a single Access Review, identified by the reviewID. Checks whether the Access Review reviews an on-premises group and if so, loads the decisions for it. If there are "deny" decisions for users, it will display a Powershell command that removes denied users from the Windows Active Directory group. This is to apply Access Reviews decisions to on-premises groups.

 .Parameter reviewID
  This is the objectID of the Access Review

 .Parameter filePath
  This is the full file path for a TXT file that Powershell commands for Windows AD are written to.

 .Example
   # Retrieve changes for on-premises group membership from the results of an Access Review - and print Powershell commands:
   Get-AzureADARSignleReviewOnPrem -reviewId 

 .Example
   # Retrieve changes for on-premises group membership from the results of an Access Review - export the Powershell commands into a TXT file:
